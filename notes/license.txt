I ask is that if you publish your game, include myself (Devon Godfrey) in the credits.

This software can be repackaged and resold as part of a completed game, it however can NOT be packaged
and resold as another extension for Game Maker or any of YoYo Games products without written permission
by myself. 

In short, if you do want to use this in an extension just ask. 

Beyond these things, use this as you see fit.
